# hapi Tutorial Series
This repository contains code examples for the [hapi tutorial series](https://futurestud.io/blog/hapi-get-your-server-up-and-running) that is published within the Future Studio University.


## Dependencies
You need the following tools installed on your machine to actually run the individual examples:

- Node.js
- NPM


## Setup
To set up the required environment, just clone this repository to your local machine and install the NPM dependencies.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:fs-opensource/nodejs-tutorials-hapi.git
$ cd nodejs-tutorials-hapi
$ npm i
```


## Run Examples
Every example code contains its own hapi server that kicks off at `localhost:3000`.

Many examples allow you to check them out within the browser. Navigate your browser to the url `localhost:3000` with a running example server in the background.
