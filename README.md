# hapi Tutorial Series
This repository contains code examples for the [hapi tutorial series](https://futurestud.io/tutorials/hapi-get-your-server-up-and-running) that is published within the Future Studio University.


## YouTube Playlist
Find a [playlist on YouTube with videos on the individual tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-o6IxDy3pIk&list=PLpUMhvC6l7AMXP2bWhHF6UTZGseIkWUG_). Each video shows you the implementation of individual featuers. Itâ€™s all practical, watch me live code :)


## Dependencies
You need the following tools installed on your machine to actually run the individual examples:

- Node.js v4+
- NPM


## Setup
To set up the required environment, just clone this repository to your local machine and install the NPM dependencies.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:fs-opensource/nodejs-tutorials-hapi.git
$ cd nodejs-tutorials-hapi
$ npm i
```


## Run Examples
Every example code contains its own hapi server that kicks off at `localhost:3000`.

```
$ cd examples
$ cd <your chosen example>
$ node server
```

Many examples allow you to check them out within the browser. Navigate your browser to the url `localhost:3000` with a running example server in the background.


## Do you wanna see a specific example?
Don't worry, just let us know :) You can file an idea within our [university-ping](https://github.com/fs-opensource/university-ping/issues/new) repository and let us know about anything you're interested to see!

Enjoy coding & make it rock!
